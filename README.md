## Thoughts blog site
- Blog site made with React, Typescript, Next Js, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity.io for data storage.
- Utilized Next Js server side rendering for fast data fetching of posts. 
- Utilized Sanity V3 that allows us to embed the admin dashboard directly into the web app for easy access through Next Js routing.
- Utilized Zod for Typescript schema validation on all http requests to Sanity.
- Utilized Zustand for state management of post likes.
- Utilized Tailwind CSS for a responsive, clean design
